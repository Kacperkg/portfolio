            Hi, I&apos;m Kacper!

              I&apos;m passionate about building beautiful and functional
              digital experiences. My main focus is front-end development, and I
              especially enjoy working with TypeScript and Reactâ€”both for web
              and React Native mobile apps.
            </p>
            <p className="text-3xl text-white/70">
              I love the creative side of development, especially seeing my work
              come to life in real time. There&apos;s something special about
              building thingsâ€”whether it&apos;s with code, Lego, or anything
              hands-on. That&apos;s why I gravitate toward front-end and
              interactive projects (and, honestly, why I&apos;m not a huge fan
              of backend work! ðŸ˜‚).
            </p>
            <p className="text-3xl text-white/70">
              I&apos;m based in the UK and open to both remote roles and
              in-person opportunities in Edinburgh or nearby. I&apos;m always
              eager to learn from more experienced developersâ€”there&apos;s no
              better way to grow than by working alongside talented people.
